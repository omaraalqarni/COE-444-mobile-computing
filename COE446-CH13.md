# CH 13: Power control



- Power control enhances battery life of the MSs
- In order to reduce interference and maximize the battery life, there is a need for the wireless network to keep track of 
  - the radio resources
  - signal strength
  - and other associated information related to communication between an MS and neighboring BSs

### Power control definition 

###### It means the algorithms, protocols, and techniques that are employed to dynamically adjust the transmit power of both MSs and BSs

------

#### Open loop power control

- implemented in the uplink
- MT measures the quality of a refrence channel from the BS using RSS or BER
- If the RSS is above a certail threshold, the mobile will reduce power and vice versa

###### Disadvantage of open loop:

- Depends only on the MS **Mobile station**

- No feedback from BS **Base station**

- **Not accurate like Closed loop, but can react quickly when the signal fluctuates**

  

1.  the decision is based on the measurements of the downlink

2. The channels are not related. **if the uplink channel has a good signal it doesn't mean that the downlink has a good signal too **

3. There may be a delay before implementing the power control

4. In TDMA (**Time division Multiple Access**), the MS reception and transmition times are different. and it will cause a time lag

   ------

   #### Closed loop power control

   - Adjust the signal strength in reverse channel based on a metric of performance
   - 

   

   

   - fixes the quality concern by implementing a feedback mechanism between the BS and the MS
   - The BS measures the quality of the signal with the MS and sends through the downlink what actions the MS should do
   - Closed loop power ctrl can be used to ctrl the **transmit signal** of the BS
